# Wordle Game & Solver

So one day, a Medium Daily Digest showed up in my email. There were some Medium articles, and one article caught my attention, the one called [How to Wordle](https://jimstump.com/how-to-wordle-89612f758152). My first reaction was, "What is this? Is this a game?" and it got me interested. After I finished reading the article, I found out more about Wordle. I started trying that day's word (I managed to guess it right if I'm not mistaken even though my guesses were random because I haven't understood the game that well :sweat_smile:).

After a few days of playing, I thought it would be interesting if I made a "helper" for this game. The first 2 videos that gave me the first hint of how should I make the solver are [Mahmood Hikmet's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJaYvxQh8w) and [William Spaniel's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUiYsPgEslo).

## The Game
So, when I started to make my own version of the game, I didn't know that the original one would only give us common English words. So I ended up looking for a full English word list that includes words with ending (not only the root words). But later on, I figured out that it is necessary to have that word list. I downloaded the word list from [here](http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html) and saved it as **vocab.txt**.
